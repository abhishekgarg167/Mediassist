# Mediassist
This is medicine provider website.
It is a medicine portal to connect the medicine needy ones with the medicine providers.
They can create their accounts and can fill profile details and details about the availability of medicines and needy ones
can search for the medicines and their providers.
I developed the front-end in HTML/CSS with JQuery.
I built the backend using NodeJS containing the application logic and MySQL database for persisting the medicine records.
